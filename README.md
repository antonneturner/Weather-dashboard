# Weather-dashboard
The name of this project is Weather Dashboard. It allows individuals to check the weather in the cities they desire. It also displays a weather icon as well as a five day future prediction forecast.
I created this dashboard to further implment my skills within Jquery,javascript, css, moment, bootstrap and html.
I made this dashboard using Apis, Ajax, Jquery, javascript, html, moment, bootstrap and css properties.
My motivation behind making this weather dashboard was to further strengthen my developer skills.
I learned much more about Apis, Ajax, Jquery javascript functions, parameters, arguements, if else statements, call back functions, moment js, arrays and intervals, and index arrays.
I also feel more confident in my usage of class selectors with jquery, as well as my over all skills as a developer. I enjoyed this project
